									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>Hello, I'm Nahjay Battieste, a dedicated Computer Engineering undergraduate with an unwavering passion for all things programming 
										and electronics. My journey into the world of computers was ignited by the mesmerizing realm of video games, and from that point 
										on, my fascination with the interplay between code and circuits has only deepened.
										As I delved further into the captivating world of computing, I discovered the enchanting intricacies 
										of electronics and the underlying physics that breathe life into every digital experience. With every line of code
										and every circuit I design, I explore the limitless possibilities at the intersection of technology, creativity, and innovation. <b>
										Join me on this journey of learning, growth, and discovery.</b></p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Background and Education</h2>
										<p> I embarked on my journey in the realm of technology and engineering with a solid foundation in academics and a relentless passion for innovation. Graduating as the salutatorian from Atlantic Technical High School in 2022, I was provided with a unique educational experience in a technical college setting. This exceptional environment allowed me to explore various technical programs, ultimately leading me to discover my fervor for engineering.</p>

											<p>During my time at Atlantic Technical High School, I delved into the world of machining, which served as my gateway to the intricate field of engineering. The hands-on experience and exposure to precision engineering techniques were pivotal in shaping my career aspirations.</p>
											
											<p>Driven by my unwavering curiosity and determination, I embarked on a journey to further expand my knowledge and skill set. This endeavor led me to secure not one, but two mechanical engineering internships, where I gained valuable insights into the practical aspects of engineering. These experiences solidified my passion for the field and motivated me to pursue it vigorously.</p>
											
											<p>Recognizing the importance of continuous learning and adaptability in the ever-evolving tech industry, I undertook rigorous self-study to transition into the dynamic realm of computer engineering. My dedication paid off as I succeeded in securing my current software engineering internship, where I have been able to apply and refine my programming skills.</p>
											
											<p>As a committed student, I am currently enrolled at Broward College, where I am on the verge of completing my two-year Associate of Arts (AA) degree program. This program has not only honed my academic abilities but has also served as a stepping stone to my future endeavors.</p>	
					
											
											<p>Looking ahead, I am excited about the prospect of transferring to the University of Florida's College of Computer Engineering in the fall of 2024. This next chapter in my educational journey will provide me with the tools and knowledge necessary to make a meaningful impact in the field of computer engineering, where my passion for programming and electronics converge.</p>
											
											<p>My educational and experiential background has equipped me with a strong foundation and an unyielding drive to excel in the world of computer engineering, and I am eager to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible in this exciting field. </p>
