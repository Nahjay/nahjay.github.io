                                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                    <p>Hello, I'm Nahjay Battieste, a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Florida focused on digital design, computer architecture, and firmware. What started as a curiosity about PC hardware and gaming has evolved into a technical pursuit of understanding how computing systems work at the lowest level. I am driven by the challenge of optimizing hardware performance and bridging the gap between silicon and software.</p>
                                    <hr />
                                    
                                    <h2>Background and Education</h2>
                                    <p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. Beyond the classroom, I am deeply embedded in the academic community as an Undergraduate Researcher at the SmartSystems Lab, where I work on FPGA-based hardware acceleration, and as a Teaching Assistant for Digital Design, helping peers master VHDL and logic synthesis.</p>

                                    <p>My technical education is reinforced by significant industry experience. I have completed two internships as a GPU Firmware Engineer at NVIDIA. These roles allowed me to contribute directly to next-generation hardware validation and automation pipelines, giving me a practical understanding of how large-scale silicon verification works in a fast-paced environment.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>My journey began at Broward College, where I earned my Associate of Arts with a focus on engineering before transferring to UF. This path, rooted in a strong work ethic and self-driven learning, has shaped my approach to engineering: I believe in rigorous problem-solving, continuous learning, and the practical application of theory to build real-world systems.</p>
